## What I learned

While working on this project, I improved my understanding of CSS Flexbox for layout structuring. Additionally, I learned how to optimize class selectors by combining similar styles without altering class names, making the CSS more efficient and readable.

Example of optimized CSS:

.pre1 span, .pre3 span {
color: hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
font-weight: 700;
}

## Continued development

In future projects, I plan to explore:

Using CSS Grid for better responsiveness

Implementing BEM methodology for better class structuring

Enhancing accessibility features for better user experience

## Useful resources

CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide - This helped me structure the layout efficiently.

MDN Web Docs - HTML & CSS - A great reference for HTML and CSS best practices.
